        <h1>Welcome to the Center for Pokemon Card Sorting</h1>

        <p>Here you can create an account and manage your pokemon card libraries.  All you need to do is create an account and add cards to your library.  Each account will be equipped with its own personal library as well as access to a national library that is composed of all cards entered by any user. </p>

        <p>You can also create your own decks from your library and the national library.  This is a work in progress so for the time, the only features for adding cards and making decks is all text based.  Eventually, the goal is to have pictures attached to the different cards as well as attacks and other features so that you can battle other users with your created decks.</p>
